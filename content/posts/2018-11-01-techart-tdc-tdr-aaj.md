## Introduction

With the increasing need to accelerate deployments of
solutions and reduce downtime, there is an increasing
need to diagnose industrial Ethernet cables in a timely and
effective manner.
Time-domain reflectometry (TDR) enables developers
to see through meters of copper and find opens, shorts,
crosses and many more issues that can impact the reliability of industrial Ethernet communication in factory floors,
process plants, logistics centers or even large indoor
farming locations.
This article covers the basics of TDR, including how to
implement a relatively simple TDR-measurement setup
without relying on a high-speed analog-to-digital converter
(ADC) or digital-to-analog converter (DAC). Also included
is how the integration of such measurement setups into TI
Ethernet physical-layer (PHY) devices can perform diagnostics directly.
