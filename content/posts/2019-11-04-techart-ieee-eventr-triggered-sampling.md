## Abstract:
Editor's notes: Non-Nyquist sampling-based event-triggered systems can enable adaptive sampling of IoT nodes resulting in large energy savings. This article reviews introductory concepts and building blocks of non-Nyquist sampling for cardiovascular monitoring systems. It further analyzes the performance of a knowledge-based adaptive sampling strategy applied to biophysiological signals such as electrocardiogram resulting in the order of magnitude reduction in sampling rates. -Subhanshu Gupta, Washington State University.
